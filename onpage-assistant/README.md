# On-Page Assistant Proof-of-Concept

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a proof-of-concept for an on-page assistant that appears in the lower left corner of a web page. This assistant will be a transparent, moving video that provides helpful information to users.

## Requirements

1. **Design and Create Animated Assistant**:

   - Design and create an animated, transparent assistant that appears in the lower left corner of a web page.

2. **Button Interaction**:

   - When a button is clicked on the page, the assistant should move to the button and explain what that button does.

3. **Hover Icon**:

   - Implement a hover icon that, when pressed, allows the assistant to provide explanations for certain elements when users hover over them.

4. **Animations**:

   - Add animations to make the assistant's movement to the button look natural and engaging.

5. **Dynamic 3D Effects (Bonus)**:

   - Explore the use of dynamic 3D effects for additional bonus points.

6. **Research and Innovation**:
   - Conduct research to find innovative techniques and technologies that can enhance the functionality and appearance of the assistant.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The on-page assistant is integrated into the web page as a transparent, moving element.
- The assistant provides clear and helpful explanations when users click on buttons or hover over specific elements.
- When a button is clicked, the assistant smoothly moves to the button and delivers a concise explanation of its function.
- The hover icon is responsive and allows users to easily access explanations for relevant elements.
- Animations are implemented to enhance the assistant's movement to buttons and overall user experience.
- If dynamic 3D effects are attempted, they are well-executed and enhance the assistant's presentation.
- The assistant's appearance and behavior are in accordance with the provided design specifications.
- Users find the assistant's interactions intuitive and helpful.
- Any technical challenges or limitations are documented, and alternative solutions are explored as part of the research effort.
- The on-page assistant project is presented as a proof-of-concept with room for potential future enhancements based on user feedback.
